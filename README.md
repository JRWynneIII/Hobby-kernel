Hobby-kernel
============

This is a simple, monolithic kernel being written as I follow various (sparse) tutorials. 

I do NOT own all of the code in this tutorial, though some of it is my own (Various parts of vga.c, system.c, as well as all of kernel.c and keyboard.c/keyboard.h are written by me.)
